        comment: "Oscar and his team were great to work with. They repaired our garage after an accident and remodeled a bathroom. His work was very high quality and we couldn't be more pleased with the result. He was very good at communicating the progress and costs. He also was very understanding regarding any changes we wanted mid project.",

        comment: "Oscar is amazing! I have already referred he and his crew to numerous people. He is kind and polite, works long, hard hours, and really delivers. He has tackled large jobs, like resurfacing the garage floor with epoxy and remodeling the powder room, to small jobs, like patching and painting the walls.",

        comment: "I recently hired Dnuevo Design to refresh the interior of my home, and I could not be happier with the experience! From the initial consultation to the final touches, their professionalism and attention to detail were outstanding. The team arrived on time, fully equipped, and ready to work. They took great care in preparing the space, ensuring everything was protected and that the work area was clean and organized. The painters were not only skilled but also incredibly friendly and respectful. They were open to feedback and made sure that every corner was perfect. The quality of the work is simply remarkable. The colors we chose turned out even better than I had envisioned, and their meticulous technique really brought my walls and kitchen to life. You can tell that they take pride in their craft! What impressed me most was their commitment to customer satisfaction. They followed up after the job was completed to ensure I was happy with everything. It is rare to find such dedication to their clients in today√¢ s market. If you are looking for a reliable, talented, and professional painting company, look no further than Dnuevo Design. I highly recommend them and will definitely be calling them again for future projects! Thank you, Dnuevo Design, for transforming my home!",
